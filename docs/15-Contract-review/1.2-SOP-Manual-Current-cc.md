## **SOP: Multi-Family / Commercial Appraisal Report Generation**

**Objective:** Generate a comprehensive appraisal report by syncing data through three stages: Valcre Online (Database) → Microsoft Excel (Analysis) → Microsoft Word (Reporting)

### **WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

Data flows **downstream only** through three stages:

```
VALCRE ONLINE → EXCEL → WORD
(Source of Truth)   (Calculation Engine)   (Presentation Layer)
```

**Critical Rule:** Never edit linked data in Word. Always fix at the source (Valcre or Excel), then refresh links.

---

### **PHASE 1: DATA ENTRY (Valcre Online)**

**Role:** Source of Truth

All static data regarding the job, property, and market comparables must be entered here first.

**1.1 Access the Job**
- Log into Valcre Online
- Navigate to the specific Job ID (e.g., "The Gateway")

**1.2 Populate Key Fields**

Fill out these tabs in the browser interface:

| Tab | Data to Enter |
|-----|---------------|
| General/Job | Job name, client info, dates of value |
| Property | Address, location data |
| Parcel/Land | Site size, zoning, legal descriptions |
| Buildings | Building details, construction year, square footage, amenities |
| Multimedia | Upload all subject property photos |

**1.3 Market Data (Comparables)**
- Go to the **Comps** tab
- Select and add relevant Sales, Leases, or Surveys for this appraisal
- These comparables will auto-populate the adjustment grids in Excel later

---

### **PHASE 2: SYNCHRONIZATION & ANALYSIS (Excel)**

**Role:** Calculation Engine

Once online data is ready, move to the Excel workbook. This is where the math happens.

**2.1 The "Valcre" Tab (The Bridge)**
- Open the Excel template
- Locate the **Valcre** tab in the top ribbon
- Click **"Load Job"** or **"Sync"** button
- Result: Pulls all data from Phase 1 into the Excel workbook, populating "Subject," "Comps," and "Desc" tabs automatically

**2.2 Review Imported Data**
- Check the **"Subject"** and **"VAL3"** tabs
- Verify address, parcel info, and building specs imported correctly
- If data is wrong: Go back to Valcre Online to fix it, then re-sync
- Do not overwrite linked cells manually

**2.3 Perform Financial Analysis (Manual Work)**

The Valcre sync does not do the valuation - it only provides raw data. Work through these analysis tabs:

| Analysis Tab | Work Required |
|--------------|---------------|
| Expense Analysis | Analyze historical expenses vs. market standards |
| Income/Revenue | Project Potential Gross Revenue (PGR) |
| Adjustments | Apply manual adjustments (location, condition, size) to imported comparables |
| Conclusion | Determine final value in Valuation & Conclusion tab |

---

### **PHASE 3: REPORT GENERATION (Word)**

**Role:** Presentation Layer

The Word document is a shell that "reads" the Excel file. Do not type numbers or property descriptions directly into Word.

**3.1 Linking the Files**
- Open the Word template
- Ensure Word document is linked to the active Excel file (via Valcre Ribbon)

**3.2 Updating the Data**
- Go to the **Valcre** tab in the Word ribbon
- Click **"Update Links"** or **"Refresh"**
- Result: Word pulls the latest data from Excel file

**3.3 Understanding Linked Elements**

Three types of data flow from Excel to Word:

| Element Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Tables | Formatting and numbers from Excel ranges | Total Rental Revenue, Miscellaneous Revenue |
| In-Text Fields | Words, dates, values embedded in paragraphs linked to Excel cells | "The subject property consists of..." |
| Images | Cover photo and subject photos pulled from Excel (which pulled from Valcre Online) | Property photographs |

**3.4 Review & Finalize**
- Review the text
- If a number is wrong, **do not fix it in Word**

**Correction Process:**
1. Go back to Excel
2. Fix the formula/input
3. Save Excel
4. Update Links in Word

---

### **TROUBLESHOOTING & FEATURES**

**"View Source" Function**
- If in Word and don't know where a number is coming from
- Use the Valcre ribbon tool
- Highlight the field and click "View Source"
- Opens the exact cell in the Excel workbook

**Ribbon Tools**
- Both Excel and Word have a dedicated "Valcre" ribbon
- Familiarize yourself with these tools
- They control the connection between web, spreadsheet, and document

---

### **KEY RULES SUMMARY**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Data flows downstream only | Valcre → Excel → Word (never reverse) |
| Fix at source | Wrong number in Word? Fix in Excel, then refresh |
| Don't overwrite linked cells | If Excel data is wrong, fix in Valcre and re-sync |
| Always Update Links | After any Excel changes, refresh Word document |
| Use View Source | When unsure where data originates, trace it back |

---

### **QUICK REFERENCE: WHERE TO FIX ISSUES**

| Issue Location | Fix Here | Then Do This |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Property address wrong in Word | Valcre Online | Sync to Excel → Update Links in Word |
| Calculation wrong in Word | Excel workbook | Save Excel → Update Links in Word |
| Photo missing in Word | Valcre Online (Multimedia tab) | Sync to Excel → Update Links in Word |
| Comparable data wrong | Valcre Online (Comps tab) | Sync to Excel → Update Links in Word |
| Expense projection wrong | Excel (Expense Analysis tab) | Save Excel → Update Links in Word |
