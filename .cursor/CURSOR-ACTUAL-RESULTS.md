**Testing URL:** https://apr-dashboard-v3.vercel.app  
**Job Tested:** VAL251014  
**Date:** January 10, 2025  

---

## Quick Summary

**Cursor Claims:** Fixed all 7 bugs  
**Reality:** Only tested 1 so far, and it FAILED

---

## Test Results

### ❌ Bug #3: Property Types Loading - **FAILED**

**Cursor Claimed:**
- Fixed `property_types` → `propertyTypes` mapping in data load
- Fixed `propertyTypes` → `property_types` mapping in data save
- "Property types persist across page reloads"

**Actual Result:**
- Property Types dropdown shows: "Add more..." (empty) ❌
- Opened dropdown: ALL 14 CHECKBOXES UNCHECKED ❌
- Valcre shows: "Industrial" ✅
- Database likely has: "Industrial" ✅
- Dashboard loading: BROKEN ❌

**Evidence:**
- Production URL loaded VAL251014
- Clicked Property Types dropdown
- Snapshot shows all options (Agriculture, Building, Healthcare, Hospitality, Industrial, etc.)
- NONE are checked

**Verdict:** Cursor did NOT fix this bug. One-way data flow still exists.

## What I'm Doing Now

Testing on PRODUCTION (https://apr-dashboard-v3.vercel.app), not localhost.

Waiting for your instruction on whether to:
1. Continue testing all 7 bugs
2. Stop and let Cursor know Bug #3 is still broken
3. Something else

**Status:** Bug #3 FAILED on production - Property Types still not loading from database
