## BUG #1: Comments Not Mapping to Valcre

### Issue Description
Client Comments and Appraiser Comments are NOT appearing in Valcre job. Both "General" and "Client" comment fields in Valcre are EMPTY.

### Evidence
- **Dashboard Input:** Client Comments = "Property is a 14,000 sq ft Industrial complex. Need appraisal for Financing/Refinancing."
- **Valcre Output:** General Comments field = EMPTY ❌
- **Valcre Output:** Client Comments field = EMPTY ❌

### User Quote
"I'm looking at the comments field, and nothing is coming in from the comments. What's good is there is a client comments and general comments block which is good. Maybe we'll make sure to do two different mapped comments. Currently, I had it going into one. I forgot that there's actually two dedicated different fields for the comments in the job."

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/utils/webhooks/valcre.ts` (Lines 265-275)

**Current Code (WRONG):**
```javascript
// Lines 265-275
const creationComments = [];
if (formData.notes) {  // notes = client comments from property section
  creationComments.push(`=== CLIENT COMMENTS ===\n${formData.notes}`);
}
if (formData.appraiserComments) {
  creationComments.push(`=== APPRAISER COMMENTS ===\n${formData.appraiserComments}`);
}
if (creationComments.length > 0) {
  jobData.Comments = creationComments.join('\n\n');  // ❌ Goes to General field only
}
```

**Problem:** Code combines both comments into single `Comments` field instead of mapping to separate fields.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/utils/webhooks/valcre.ts` (Lines 265-275)

**Replace With:**
```javascript
// Map client comments to ClientComments field
if (formData.notes) {
  jobData.ClientComments = formData.notes;  // ✅ Goes to Valcre "Client" field
}

// Map appraiser comments to Comments field (General)
if (formData.appraiserComments) {
  jobData.Comments = formData.appraiserComments;  // ✅ Goes to Valcre "General" field
}
```

### Validation
**Reference:** `api/valcre.ts` (Lines 810, 813-814) already expects separate fields:
```javascript
// Line 810: Comments field for internal notes only
Comments: jobData.InternalComments || "",

// Line 813-814: Client-visible comments
ClientComments: jobData.ClientComments || jobData.SpecialInstructions || "",
```

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix to `src/utils/webhooks/valcre.ts`
2. Create new test job with Client Comments: "Test client notes"
3. Add Appraiser Comments: "Test appraiser notes"
4. Submit job to Valcre
5. Open job in Valcre UI
6. Verify "Client" field shows "Test client notes"
7. Verify "General" field shows "Test appraiser notes"

## BUG #2: Valuation Premises Not Auto-Saving

### Issue Description
Changing Valuation Premises dropdown does NOT trigger auto-save or sync to Valcre.

### Evidence
- **Test Performed:** Changed dropdown from "Select..." to "Market Rent"
- **Expected:** Toast notification + console log + sync to Valcre
- **Actual:** No console log, no notification, no sync ❌

### User Quote
"I changed it, nothing spiraled to say it updated or no error or anything. So I don't think it's even mapping."

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Valuation Premises dropdown does NOT have onChange handler with auto-save logic.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

1. Add onChange handler to Valuation Premises dropdown
2. Implement auto-save logic:
   - Save to Supabase database
   - Sync to Valcre (if job exists)
   - Show toast notification
3. Follow pattern used by working fields (Appraisal Fee, Retainer Amount)

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix
2. Open job VAL251014
3. Change Valuation Premises to "Market Rent"
4. Verify toast notification appears
5. Reload page - verify "Market Rent" persists
6. Open Valcre job - verify "Market Rent" shows in Valcre

## BUG #3: Property Types Not Loading from Database

### Issue Description
Property Types displays as EMPTY ("Add more...") in dashboard, but shows "Industrial" in Valcre. This is a one-way data flow issue.

### Evidence
- **Dashboard Display:** "Add more..." with all 14 checkboxes UNCHECKED ❌
- **Valcre Display:** "Industrial" ✅
- **Conclusion:** Property Type WAS sent during job creation, but is NOT loading back from database into UI

### User Quote
"we didn't even choose a property type in this job. The hell, but there was a property type. That's weird. So there was a property type in the test in Valcre, but I don't think we chose one here."

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Missing bidirectional data binding. Property Types:
- ✅ Sends to Valcre during job creation
- ❌ Does NOT load from database on component mount
- ❌ Does NOT check boxes based on saved values

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

1. Add database query on component mount to load saved property types
2. Check appropriate checkboxes based on saved values
3. Add onChange handler with auto-save logic (like other fields)
4. Ensure bidirectional sync: Dashboard ↔ Database ↔ Valcre

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix
2. Create new job, select "Industrial" property type
3. Submit to Valcre
4. Verify Valcre shows "Industrial" ✅
5. Reload dashboard page
6. Verify "Industrial" checkbox is CHECKED ✅
7. Uncheck "Industrial", check "Retail"
8. Verify toast notification
9. Verify Valcre updates to "Retail"

## BUG #4: Intended Use Not Auto-Saving

### Issue Description
Changing Intended Use dropdown does NOT trigger auto-save or sync to Valcre.

### Evidence
- **Test Performed:** Changed dropdown value
- **Expected:** Toast notification + sync to Valcre
- **Actual:** No update notification appeared ❌

### User Quote
"intended use and asset condition. I changed both, and still no indication that it was saved or indication that it synced to Valcre"

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Intended Use dropdown does NOT have onChange handler with auto-save logic.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

1. Add onChange handler to Intended Use dropdown
2. Implement auto-save logic (save to DB + sync to Valcre + toast)
3. Follow pattern used by working fields

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix
2. Open job VAL251014
3. Change Intended Use value
4. Verify toast notification appears
5. Reload page - verify change persists
6. Open Valcre job - verify change synced

---

## BUG #5: Asset Condition Not Auto-Saving

### Issue Description
Changing Asset Condition dropdown does NOT trigger auto-save or sync to Valcre.

### Evidence
- **Test Performed:** Changed dropdown value
- **Expected:** Toast notification + sync to Valcre
- **Actual:** No update notification appeared ❌

### User Quote
"intended use and asset condition. I changed both, and still no indication that it was saved or indication that it synced to Valcre"

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Asset Condition dropdown does NOT have onChange handler with auto-save logic.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

1. Add onChange handler to Asset Condition dropdown
2. Implement auto-save logic (save to DB + sync to Valcre + toast)
3. Follow pattern used by working fields

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix
2. Open job VAL251014
3. Change Asset Condition value
4. Verify toast notification appears
5. Reload page - verify change persists

## BUG #6: Appraiser Comments Not Auto-Saving

### Issue Description
Adding text to Appraiser Comments field does NOT trigger auto-save or sync to Valcre. No spinning indicator appears.

### Evidence
- **Test Performed:** Added text to Appraiser Comments field
- **Expected:** Spinning indicator + toast notification + sync to Valcre
- **Actual:** No spinning indicator, no notification ❌
- **Comparison:** Price field DOES show spinning indicator when changed ✅

### User Quote
"I just added a comment to the appraiser comments section, and I did not see the little spinning update thing. But I did change the price, and I did see the spinning update thing."

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Appraiser Comments textarea does NOT have onBlur handler with auto-save logic.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

3. Show spinning indicator during save (like price field)
4. Follow pattern used by working fields

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix
2. Open job VAL251014

## BUG #7: Missing Toast Notifications for All Field Saves

### Issue Description
Most field saves do NOT display toast notifications. Only "Preview & Send LOE" button shows proper toast notification.

### Current Behavior
- **Appraisal Fee/Retainer Amount:** Show subtle spinning indicator only (no toast) ❌
- **Preview & Send LOE Button:** Shows toast notification "Preview generated - please review before sending" ✅
- **All Other Fields:** No feedback at all ❌

### User Provided Screenshot
Toast notification example (bottom of screen):
```
"Preview generated - please review before sending"
```

### User Quote
"So we got to have it so it brings up that lower prompt that pops up in the bottom of the window... That thing is cool to have. It's a nice little indicator that things are loading. That definitely does not come up when I do a lot of the other changes, so that indicates that the other changes are not syncing."

### Root Cause
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

**Problem:** Auto-save handlers are NOT calling toast notification system after successful saves.

### The Fix
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/job-details/LoeQuoteSection.tsx`

1. Identify/create toast notification component (likely already exists for "Preview generated")
2. Add toast notifications to ALL auto-save operations:
   - **On Save Success:** "Field updated successfully" or "Synced to Valcre"
   - **On Save Error:** "Failed to update field" with error message
3. Match style of existing "Preview generated" notification
4. Display at bottom of screen
5. Duration: 3-5 seconds

### Pattern to Implement
```typescript
const handleFieldChange = async (fieldName: string, value: any) => {
  try {
    // 1. Update local state
    setFieldValue(value);
    
    // 2. Save to Supabase
    await updateJobField(jobId, fieldName, value);
    
    // 3. Sync to Valcre (if job exists in Valcre)
    if (valcreJobNumber) {
      await syncToValcre(valcreJobNumber, { [fieldName]: value });
    }
    
    // 4. Show success toast ✅ THIS IS WHAT'S MISSING
    showToast('success', 'Field updated and synced to Valcre');
  } catch (error) {
    showToast('error', `Failed to update ${fieldName}: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
```

### Testing Steps
1. Apply fix to all auto-save handlers
2. Test each field individually:
   - Appraisal Fee - verify toast appears
   - Retainer Amount - verify toast appears
   - Valuation Premises - verify toast appears
   - Intended Use - verify toast appears
   - Asset Condition - verify toast appears
   - Property Types - verify toast appears
   - Appraiser Comments - verify toast appears
3. Verify toast matches style of "Preview generated" notification
4. Verify toast appears at bottom of screen
5. Verify toast auto-dismisses after 3-5 seconds
